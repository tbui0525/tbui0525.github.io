<p>Hi! My name is Thomas Bui. I am currently doing research at SDSU, pursing a Master's of Science in Big Data Analytics.</p>

<p>This is my climate research log where I will freely put my code and explain the research I have done/am doing in addition to other projects I have done for my Master's program</p>

<p class="mb-5">For more detail on my climate research progress, you will find them under Posts.</p>
