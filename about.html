<p>Hi! My name is Thomas Bui. I am currently doing research at SDSU, pursing a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics with an Emphasis in Physics.</p>

<p>This is my climate research log where I will freely put my code and explain the research I have done/am doing.</p>

<p class="mb-5">For more detail on my climate research progress, you will find them under Posts.</p>
